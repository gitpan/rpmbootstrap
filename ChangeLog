2012-10-21  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1661] - Introduce a pb_exit function and use it in all apps

2012-10-07  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1652] - As Red Hat 6.2 in chroot doesn't support setarch i386
	  for a x86_64 environment, we have to fake x86_64 rpm build in
	  /etc/rpmrc
	  - Red Hat 6.2 builds with the rpm command, not rpmbuild
	  - Red Hat 6.2 sudo doesn't support the env_keep var, remove it

2012-09-26  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1645] - Adds support for a RedHat 6.2 VE by first making newve
	  work, and rpmbootstrap support non-yum type of install with a
	  full list of deps.

2012-05-26  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1603] - pbtest now uses debian-6.0 has the correct distro name
	  and points to mandriva 2011.0
	  - pbtest now first umounts potential remaining /proc FS left from
	  previous run and has a build dep fo deb on gcc
	  - pb: removes a useless chown in it which was always failing
	  - Fix errors in mageia deps
	  - Fix typo in Base.pm
	  - rpmbootstrap needs aaa_base for VE seyup with zypper, in order
	  to add passwd file e.g.

2012-05-24  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1595] - pb_system is back to 3 params, as the previously
	  undocumented "mayfail" 3rd parameter povides what the 4th was
	  dded for. callers adapted in relationship

2012-05-22  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1564] - Fix typo n rpmbootstrap preventing it to run
	  - Fix the detection of setarch call with a more correct regexp
	  - New mageia mirror used (similar as mandriva)
	  - Add a test script to have a full regression suite before
	  publishing a new version

2012-05-13  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r1534] rpmbootstrap: Add Copyrights specified by HP Open Source
	  Review Board (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1533] - rpmbootstrap: If we have a proxy defined, write it into
	  /etc/sysconfig/proxy. Otherwise one of the opensuse's doesn't
	  work right. Various hacks to keep the redhat distros from
	  destroying the nis name of the machine during the install (in
	  comment). (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1532] - rpmbootstrap: Improve error message, include why the
	  download failed (turned out web server was being slow). Strip off
	  spaces in package names appearing because of multi-line conf file
	  support. Download files to a temporary name so that ctrl-c won't
	  leave around bad .rpm files. (Eric Anderson)
	* [r1531] rpmbootstrap: Add support for stop-on-error. Expand out
	  VE paths. Error out if no packages are defined for the OS version
	  since that indicates something is badly wrong. Track the packages
	  that we install so that we can re-install them with the vendor's
	  tool. Don't mount proc if it is already mounted. Only process
	  repo files under yum.repos.d. In comment for now: Include all the
	  packages installed during bootstrapping in the list of packages
	  to re-install for yum and zypper. If you don't do this for yum,
	  you end up with the generic fedora release file which doesn't
	  match the pattern expected to determine the version. If you don't
	  do this for zypper, then /etc/passwd isn't created, which creates
	  failures later. Remove the zypper repository before adding, just
	  adding fails since it already exists. Hack to fix up the
	  yum.repos.d files again after the yum install since centos 6
	  mangles them during install. Report on broken packages listed for
	  installation at the end so the warning isn't hidden. (Eric
	  Anderson)

2012-02-26  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	  and allow direct call
	  - Use pb_check_req to avoid some hardcoded path
